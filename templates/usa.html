US education is the most leading education system in the whole world and accepted by each nook and corner of the globe. Getting the US education is not a easy task like other.There are more than 4800 accredited colleges/ Universities in USA. Getting admission in the right school is the most difficult task for international students. It takes careful preparation, research and counselling. The US institutions offer a wide variety of majors (subject area of study) to study, everything from the liberal arts & sciences to professional, career-oriented fields such as engineering, sciences and technology or business.
Admission requirements differ greatly from one institution to another. Most schools will require TOEFL and SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test), GRE (Graduate Record Exam), GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test), letters of recommendation, reference letters etc.
Each College or University has its own unique policies regarding admissions or scholarships for international students. Hence, it is very important to have all the detailed information on US institutions through the help of their websites or prospectus before the application is processed. The deadline of the application also defers from one institution to another. Hence, It is very important to begin the admission process as early as possible.
