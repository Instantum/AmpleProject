New Zealand
Why New Zealand?

New Zealand, famous for its amazing scenery, is a great country - a fun place to visit and a superb study destination. New Zealand is around the same size as Japan or Great Britain. The countryside is unique and quite spectacular, from rolling green hills to golden sand beaches then lush rainforests, all within a few hours drive. New Zealand has just over four million people, know affectionately as ‘Kiwis’, who are easy going, warm and welcoming to their neighbours and to those who travel to experience all that is New Zealand. New Zealanders travel overseas a lot and this means they are well used to a range of cultures. New Zealand itself is a multi-cultural nation, with a fusion of Maori (the indigenous people), Pacific Island, European and Asian people combining to make a vibrant and colourful society. The climate in New Zealand is temperate with relatively mild, wet winters, with temperature between 10 and 15ºC, and warm, dry summers where temperatures range from 20 to 30ºC. The summer months are December, January, February, and the winter months are June, July and August. New Zealand also has an international reputation as a provider of quality education. It offers a safe learning environment which provides excellent study opportunities and support services for international students. Courses are available for academic, professional and vocational studies at universities, polytechnics, colleges of education, secondary schools and private training establishments. New Zealanders are well travelled, with a great interest in people from other cultures, so visitors and international students soon feel more than welcome. Campuses are highly international, with students from all corners of the globe studying and socialising together. Students come from Europe, South East Asia, the UK, North Asia, Japan, South America, India, and Australia, amongst many others. New Zealand offers a progressive education to help students take a leading place in the exciting global environment, with many New Zealanders working internationally or involved in collaborative research with many prestigious overseas universities. There are many state-of-the-art facilities, and with many institutions spearheading several new technological developments, students have access to more advanced technology than they could wish for. As a result, New Zealand produces top graduates who can take their place in the international arena with confidence. New Zealand offers the best of both worlds: - the sophistication and excitement of a cosmopolitan country mixed with an easy-going lifestyle. Thousands of students are choosing to study here, to further their English, broaden their knowledge and improve their job prospects in the global marketplace.
